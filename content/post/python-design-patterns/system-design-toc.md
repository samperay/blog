## SOLID Principles

SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles that can help you write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code based on well-designed, cleanly structured classes.

- Understand the meaning and purpose of each SOLID principle
- Identify Python code that violates some of the SOLID principles
- Apply the SOLID principles to refactor your Python code and improve its design
